                  &#8226; <span>CHALLENGE:</span> This private pool installation and maintenance company was looking to mitigate a falling out with a previous freelancer who had abandoned the project halfway through the website content architecture stage. The previous website was over 10 years old and not workable on a mobile device, and the new website was only half designed in bits and pieces.
                        <br><br> 
                  &#8226; <span>SOLUTIONS:</span> I was able to jump in where the previous designer left off and quickly organize the content and create wireframes to test the initial structure. Because the project was already so far behind the business's initial timeline, I chose to purchase a website template and modify the Css &amp; Html. This allowed me to deliver a fully functional and responsive website in one month, which increased customer traffic by 15%.

            I began with competitive market research coupled with detailed qualitative interviews with business owner and key informants to learn more about the specific business challenges, goals, and user base. As a long time resident of the community this company operated within, I was familiar with some of the unique struggles this user base face. Many are over the age of 60 with diminished vision and are only part time residents to the area and often get lost or confused on the back roads the company is located on.

                 Partnered with the business owner and key opinion leaders to define key objectives and clearly outline design deliverables, which were: a more intuitive and user friendly web interface designed and coded, updated branding materials, and marking image retouching. To solve to some of the specific user needs, I determined that the website needed clear visuals that were easy to see and could be enlarged for better viewing. I also provided a visual map with the link to the companies physical location in case they got lost and weren't clear on how to use GPS.

    Due to time constraints, I started with a coded template I could then modify to the brand specificiations. This also allowed me to quickly code a mockup of just the landing page to get visual approval from the client, followed by  detailed wireframes of the balance of pages in order to convey total picture to business owner and conduct initial user testing.

        One large issue that came up during this stage was the quality of the product photographs the owner provided to user for this project. Most were dark and very hard to see and wouldn't make a compelling sell on this new site. Fortunately, I was able to use my photoshop retouching skills to enhance a majority of the photos enough that they could be included.

   User testing was a challenge as this was during Covid quarantine, but it was an opportunity to learn to manage the process remotely by using Zoom screen share tools to work with the client and key informants for user testing. I had done a thorough job with content layout and architecture during the prototyping stage and getting user feedback at that stage, so at this point the testing was primarily regarding website functionality and any coding issues when the site was launched. 
                         <br><br>
                        To test the functionality of the website I first tested that it was rendering as itended on different browsers at maxiumum width. The primary issue at this stage was that the images I had used were too large to render properly, so I went through and reduced the size as much as possible while preserving the image's resolution. I then proceeded to test the site on different browsers at each break point and on different devices, starting at mobile and working my way up to large size.

                       Given additional resources I would like  In hindsight and after completing a course on accesiblity, I would also go back and ensure the colors and code all passed WCAG &amp; ADA compliance guidelines. Below is a quick mock up of the adjusted visual accesibility.

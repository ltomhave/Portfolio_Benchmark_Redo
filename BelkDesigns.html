                <p>
                    The Crown & Ivy Girls brand was a private brand launched in 2018 to fill a whitespace within the Belk business for a preppy and colorful kid's brand that would appeal to the moms who bought Crown & Ivy Missy clothing.   
               After a year of success designing for the Missy brand, I was given the opportunity to launch and manage the customer experience of this kid's line. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    New to children's wear, my first step was to conduct extensive on the customer including stakeholder interviews within the Belk organization to better understand the information that already existed on children's wear brands and the customer.
                    </p>
                    <div class="photorow1">

                    <p>
                    I also conducted extensive market research to identify benchmark brands within the kid's sector that aligned with our target customer and the missy aesthetic. 
                    The below branding packet is a summary of my research which provides context for the visual guidelines included.

                <p>
                    As the brand was intended to appeal to the moms who bought Crown & Ivy Missy product, I identified an opportunity to capitalize on the popular Mommy &amp; Me instagram trend of moms dressing similarly to their kid's. 
                   The below are from our very successful brand launch as well as the Mommy &amp; Me campaign.  
                   The success of this launch led to additional brand growth that resulted in the Crown & Ivy brand being the #1 private brand for Belk, generating $40 million a year in revenue.

                   The success of the Crown & Ivy Girls line led to the ownership and product management of a growing Crown & Ivy total kid's brand, including girls, boys, and babies. Each had their own unique demographic and challenges that still needed to be cohesive to the total brand vision.
                   Below is a breakdown of the product development lifecycle/

                   Each season I started by developing a perspective on brand strategy that would identify opportunities for brand growth, areas to maintain, and where we should reduce focus in order to hit KPIs and business goals.
                   Below is an example of a summary of my findings within the market, an analysis of LY sales and KPIs, and research with the end user to determine customer satisfaction and opportunities.

                     This ended up being one of the most useful tools in my arsenal. It allowed me to effectively break down and push for the brand vision and big ideas. 
                    It was also a living document that we shared with cross functional partners to create a robust dialogue as we partnered to refine the document. It created an alignment on strategy, a functional checklist, and also served as accountability across the brand.

                <p>
With a seasonal framework built on data and research I was able to proceed with a 2-pronged approach to designing the total brand experience. The first was designing the brand and the second was designing the branding that would influence the customer's experience with that brand. 
At this point I would lead a team of junior designers in designing seasonally specific mood boards, product, and marketing strategies.

                    Capitalizing on the success of the Mommy &amp; Me marketing, I then led a cross functional design team in identifying total family marketing opportunities for the season, fleshing out these ideas with great product from each brand segment, and managing the development and communication to the marketing and merchant teams. 
                    This required both tactful diplomacy as well as a firm push to maintain the overall vision and ensure each team was clear, aligned, and following through on their deliverables. 
The below are examples of some of our highly successful marketing campaigns.

                        <p>
                               With product on the market, I was able to connect with real customers both in store and online and continue to gain empathy for their needs and pain points throughout their experience with the brand.
                              I took the initiative to create questionnaires around the brand experience and customer and went to a sampling of stores to conduct user interviews.

                              I also analyzed selling reports to determine was and wasn't working and conducted audits of each touch point the customer would have with the brand to ensure quality.

                            <p>
                              I used these findings to ensure the current customer experience was up to quality and also to back up my design decisions on future seasons as I continued to advocated for the customer.

                <p>
              
                    The Crown & Ivy Kids customer wants to be able to put together easy and adorable outfits for her kids.  Some of the biggest wins for the brand have been where great product and  marketing have come together to tell a cohesive story that sells the customer on the total vision. Our Family Moments campaigns showcase coordinated family outfits that make it easy for the customer to envision her family in them and then purchase everything at once.  
She also wants to be delighted by the product and feel like it’s a value for her dollar.
<br>         
 <h5>Opportunities to Improve: </h5>
        
<p>  
                    The Crown & Ivy Kids customer shops us because we’re as unique as her family is and she wants to see the value in the purchase.  She’s market savvy and has not been inclined to purchase more basic items that she can get from another retailer who can sell it at a lower price point. 
Another learning is that kid’s are picky, and parents know it.  They can spot right away if something is not soft enough or too uptight or has too many buttons for their 3 year old to do by themselves is  not worth the pain to get a child into it. Silhouettes need to be easy to get into, wear, and then get out of quickly to make the customer’s experience of the product significantly better.

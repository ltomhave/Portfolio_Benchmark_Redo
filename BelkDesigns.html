                <p>
                    The Crown & Ivy Girls brand was a private brand launched in 2018 to fill a whitespace within the Belk business for a preppy and colorful kid's brand that would appeal to the moms who bought Crown & Ivy Missy clothing.   
                    After a year of success designing for the Missy brand, I was given the opportunity to launch and manage the customer experience of this kid's line.

          <p>
            As the brand was intended to appeal to the moms who bought Crown & Ivy Missy product, I identified an opportunity to capitalize on the popular Mommy &amp; Me instagram trend of moms dressing similarly to their kid's. 
            The below are from our very successful brand launch as well as the Mommy &amp; Me campaign.

                <p>
                    Each season I started by developing a perspective on brand strategy that would identify opportunities for brand growth, areas to maintain, and where we should reduce focus in order to hit KPIs and business goals.
                    Below is an example of a summary of my findings within the market, an analysis of LY sales and KPIs, and research with the end user to determine customer satisfaction and opportunities.

                    <h5> &nbsp; </h5>
                    <p>
                    This ended up being one of the most useful tools in my arsenal. It allowed me to effectively break down and push for the brand vision and big ideas. 
                    It was also a living document that we shared with cross functional partners to create a robust dialogue as we partnered to refine the document. It created an alignment on strategy, a functional checklist, and also served as accountability across the brand.

                        <h5>Delivering on the Opportunity</h5>
                        <p>
                            With a seasonal framework built on data and research I was able to proceed with a 2-pronged approach to designing the total brand experience. The first was designing the brand and the second was designing the branding that would influence the customer's experience with that brand. 
  
                        </p>

                            <p>
                                At this point I would lead a team of junior designers in designing seasonally specific mood boards, product, and marketing strategies.

                      <h5>Marketing the Product</h5>
                      <p>
                        Capitalizing on the success of the Mommy &amp; Me marketing, I then led a cross functional design team in identifying total family marketing opportunities for the season, fleshing out these ideas with great product from each brand segment, and managing the development and communication to the marketing and merchant teams.

                        This required both tactful diplomacy as well as a firm push to maintain the overall vision and ensure each team was clear, aligned, and following through on their deliverables.

                        With product on the market, I was able to connect with real customers both in store and online and continue to gain empathy for their needs and pain points throughout their experience with the brand.
                        I took the initiative to create questionnaires around the brand experience and customer

                            and went to a sampling of stores to conduct user interviews.
                            I also analyzed selling reports to determine was and wasn't working and conducted audits of each touch point the customer would have with the brand to ensure quality.                               I used these findings to ensure the current customer experience was up to quality and also to back up my design decisions on future seasons as I continued to advocated for the customer.

Our Family Moments campaigns showcase coordinated family outfits that make it easy for the customer to envision her family in them and then purchase everything at once.

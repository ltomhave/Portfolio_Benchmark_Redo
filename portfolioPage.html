            <p>
                &#8226; <span>THE PROJECT:</span>
                <br>
                To partner within an agile team of engineers in the Wells Fargo organization to design and develop the user interface for an internal real estate evaluation system to be used by appraisers to collect data and conduct appraisals. 
                <br><br>
                &#8226; <span>THE GOALS:</span>
                <br>
                To create a web application that would streamline, simplify, and standardize the appraisal documentation process for real estate appraisers. 
                <br><br>
                &#8226; <span>THE CHALLENGES:</span>
                <br>
                &#8212;
                No exposure to actual users as management felt that the above assets were enough for the team 
                     <br> &#8212;
                     The existing excel document the appraisers used was complex and dynamic. It was hard to determine each field and use case based on just working through the document and training videos 
                     <br> &#8212;
                      Extreme time constraints. Management wanted the application launched and able to use within 6 months 
                      <br><br>
                &#8226; <span>THE OUTCOMES:</span>
                <br>
                &#8212;
A robust prototype of the commercial appraisal web application that streamlined the user experience by reducing the input of duplicative information and provided easy ways to access, edit, and attach images, maps, and other addendum's to complete the appraisal. 
                     <br>  &#8212;
HTML/CSS templates of the main form pages to ensure the responsive design, interaction, and visual system are the same across the application. 
                    
                <br><br>

                <p>
                 The planning stage consisted of 3 parts. Gathering and understanding the application's requirements by learning the current commercial appraisal process and tools, analyzing what we can use of the existing residential web application that the commercial app would be based off of, and meeting with the product owner and lead engineers to formulate a working road map. 
                </p>
           
                <p>
                  This was both the easiest and hardest part of the project. The appraisal team already had a robust and dynamic excel document for creating appraisals as well as good training videos of how to use it. There was also an existing application for the residential appraisal team that was seen as a good starting point for the commercial application. This made it easy to walk in the user's footsteps and gain empathy for their process and pain points.  
                  The downside was because we had those tools, management did not feel we needed to take up the user's time by working with them directly, despite pushing for direct user input. As we worked to streamline the process, this did lead to some educated speculation on behalf of the user.
                   In hindsight, it would have been ideal to go through the high fidelity prototype with the users and get sign off prior to proceeding with development. I was only involved in the user interface design but anticipate this causing more rework for the engineer team. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below are examples of the original excel document that we were given against the web application pages. While robust, the document was also very complex, consisting of at least 50 different pages and multiple dynamic text fields.

                <p>
                    Once I understood the requirements and current state of the commercial appraisal business, I was able to compare against the existing residential app to determine what we could use, what could be improved, and what needed to be done from scratch from a user experience perspective. This was in partnership with the lead engineers who did the same thing from their perspective. In reality, only about 50% of the existing framework from residential was usable.
                    The residential application form UI was a PDF format that wasn't easily scannable for the user. It also wasn't responsive, which made it very hard to view on different devices.

    Our combined analysis allowed us to partner on creating a general framework for the application. 
    Text fields were cataloged with duplicative information reduced or combined in a separate excel doc by page. I then created a quick medium fidelity black/white mockup of the first few pages as a jumping off point to discuss the visual framework and conventions with internal team and get early buy in.

                I began the UI piece by analyzing the Wells Fargo existing customer facing design system and referring to it as a base. As we progressed I modified the color and visual design system based on the the specific business needs. For example, I chose levels of the standard yellow to represent various hierarchies within the form. I also reduced the amount of space between form fields to help reduce the total length of the form while still maintaining readability. Due to time constraints and the need to multi task this process happened in tandem with creating the mid and high fidelity prototypes.
                   I documented all the visual standards in our <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/RtgMd0a7zWG0R6qxwNIVEJ/WEB-APP-V2?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=1%3A2&viewport=365%2C277%2C0.26&scaling=contain&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2 " target="_blank">design system document</a> for referral.

                    The prototype was created and signed off on in 5-6 page groupings, again due to time restraints and the need to pass pages off to the engineering team during the next spring. This approach had the advantage of allowing us to quickly move to development but also created a lot of rework as we were always re-analyzing the complex and dynamic nature of the application and working through total user flows in pieces.
                    Part of my role was to bridge the gap between this process and an engineering team that was spread across 2 countries and time zones, relaying any changes, style updates, etc. To ensure clarity I took a multi-pronged approach to communication. During daily stand ups I would walk the team through any new information and reiterate changes via e-mail, which acted as a running change log. I also ensured the prototype, CSS, and design system document were up to date and the team had access to the files.

                    Once the mockup was signed off on by the product manager, I coded the initial HTML and CSS in Visual Code Studio for each type of page as a template to pass off the software engineers. Below is an example of the responsive design across 4 different devices.

                    Due to time constraints and lack of access to the end user, the initial testing I was involved in was done internally with our product group. As each section was completed I partnered with engineer team to walk through and test application clarify, functionality, accessibility, and general usage. 
                    I also ensured the visual system and interactions met the quality and visual standards across the application.

                        Given different time restraints, I’d want to be involved in troubleshooting and gaining feedback upon the release to the business users. Ideally, this would be with a core group of business users that could provide structured feedback that would allow us to improve the application before a wide release.

My biggest takeaway from this project was the ability to work and solve problems independently as well as part of a team. As the requirements for the role changed I was tasked with coding templates in HTML and CSS, a weaker skill set before this role. 
The reality of the tight time frame meant that no one else on the team had the time to hold my hand as I learned. I was able to be successful in this role by taking responsibility for finding online resources and figuring it out as I went, a true trial and error process. 
                </p>
                <p>
    In reevaluating the design, I would have liked to have more time during the planning stage to work through information architecture. For instance, there were a lot of menus with different functionality and I think we could have spent more time breaking down the actual information architecture to make it more clear for the user and relied less on the existing excel documents and systems.

                <p>
                    The Crown & Ivy Girls brand was a private brand launched in 2018 to fill a whitespace within the Belk business for a preppy and colorful kid's brand that would appeal to the moms who bought Crown & Ivy Missy clothing.   
               After a year of success designing for the Missy brand, I was given the opportunity to launch and manage the customer experience of this kid's line. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    New to childrenswear, my first step was to conduct extensive research on the market and to gather any existing information available within the Belk organization on the target demographic. 
                    I partnered with merchant teams to get intel on the other kid's brands. This helped me learn what generally works, what doesn't, and further identify the product and aesthetic gap. 
                    I then used my market research to identify benchmark brands within the kid's sector that aligned with our target customer and the missy aesthetic. 
                    The below branding packet is a summary of that research which provides context for the visual guidelines included.

                    As the brand was intended to appeal to the moms who bought Crown & Ivy Missy product, I identified an opportunity to capitalize on the popular Mommy &amp; Me instagram trend of moms dressing similarly to their kid's. 
                   The below are from our very successful brand launch as well as the Mommy &amp; Me campaign.  
                   The success of this launch led to additional brand growth that resulted in the Crown & Ivy brand being the #1 private brand for Belk.

                <h3><span class="tl-duration">2&nbsp - &nbsp;</span>Creating a Strategy</h3>
                <p>
                   The success of the Crown & Ivy Girls line led to the ownership of a growing Crown & Ivy total kid's brand, including girls, boys, and babies. Each had their own unique demographic and challenges that still needed to be cohesive to the total brand vision.
                   <br>
                   Each season I started by developing a perspective on brand strategy that would identify opportunities for brand growth, areas to maintain, and where we should reduce focus in order to hit KPIs and business goals.
                   Below is an example of a summary of my findings within the market, an analysis of LY sales and KPIs, and research with the end user to determine customer satisfaction and opportunities. 
                   <br>
                   This ended up being one of the most useful tools in my arsenal. It allowed me to effectively break down and push for the brand vision and big ideas. 
                    It was also a living document that we shared with cross functional partners to create a robust dialogue as we partnered to refine the document. It created an alignment on strategy, a functional checklist, and also served as accountability across the brand.
                    Below you can see an example of how the process evolved for one season from strategy, to concept, to design.

                <p>
With a seasonal framework built on data and research I was able to proceed with a 2-pronged approach to designing the total brand experience. The first was designing the brand and the second was designing the branding that would influence the customer's experience with that brand. 
At this point I would lead a team of junior designers in designing seasonally specific mood boards, product, and marketing strategies.

                    Capitalizing on the success of the Mommy &amp; Me marketing, I then led a cross functional design team in identifying total family marketing opportunities for the season, fleshing out these ideas with great product from each brand segment, and managing the development and communication to the marketing and merchant teams. 
                    This required both tactful diplomacy as well as a firm push to maintain the overall vision and ensure each team was clear, aligned, and following through on their deliverables. 
                    For instance, because men's, women's, and kid's brands were bought by different teams, I often had to coordinate with the buyers to ensure they would actually purchase the product designed for that look to ensure it was available for marketing to use. 
The below are examples of some of our highly successful marketing campaigns.

                        <p>
                            My role post launch to be just as critical as the branding and product design/management. 
                              With product on the market, I was able to connect with real customers both in store and online and continue to gain empathy for their needs and pain points throughout their experience with the brand.
                              I took the initiative to create questionnaires around the brand experience and customer and went to a sampling of stores to conduct user interviews.
                              I also analyzed selling reports to determine was and wasn't working and conducted audits of each touch point the customer would have with the brand to ensure quality.
                              I used these findings to ensure the current customer experience was up to quality and also to back up my design decisions on future seasons as I continued to advocated for the customer.

            <h5>What worked:</h5>
                <p>
              
                    The Crown & Ivy Kids customer wants to be able to put together easy and adorable outfits for her kids.  Some of the biggest wins for the brand have been where great product and  marketing have come together to tell a cohesive story that sells the customer on the total vision. Our Family Moments campaigns showcase coordinated family outfits that make it easy for the customer to envision her family in them and then purchase everything at once.  
She also wants to be delighted by the product and feel like it’s a value for her dollar. She loves newness in thoughtful details, whimsy graphics and one of a kind prints that feel like a steal at the price she pays. 
</p>
<br>         
 <h5>Opportunities to Improve: </h5>
        
<p>  
                    The Crown & Ivy Kids customer shops us because we’re as unique as her family is and she wants to see the value in the purchase.  She’s market savvy and has not been inclined to purchase more basic items that she can get from another retailer who can sell it at a lower price point. 
Another learning is that kid’s are picky, and parents know it.  They can spot right away if something is not soft enough or too uptight or has too many buttons for their 3 year old to do by themselves is  not worth the pain to get a child into it. Silhouettes need to be easy to get into, wear, and then get out of quickly to make the customer’s experience of the product significantly better.

                &#8226; <span>THE PROJECT:</span>
                <br>
                To create a pet rescue app that will allow you to notify neighbors to get your animals out of your home in case of an emergency. 
                <br><br>
                &#8226; <span>THE CHALLENGES:</span>
                <br>
                The current website is older and hard to navigate and there isn't much information
                about the birds available. The secondary challenge is that with a small volunteer
                staff the rescue is overwhelmed with the current workload of paper forms.
                <br><br>
                &#8226; <span>THE GOALS:</span>
                <br>To increase bird adoption and retention rate by 15% by connecting the right
                people with the right bird.

                                    The Feathered Friends bird rescue wants to update and overhaul their website to
                                    streamline the experience for a user to view, support, foster, and adopt birds.

                                    <br>
                                    The current website is older and hard to navigate and there isn't much information
                                    about the birds available. The secondary challenge is that with a small volunteer
                                    staff the rescue is overwhelmed with the current workload of paper forms.

                                        goals and frustrations of both the user and rescue operation. I then conducted
                                        extensive market research of other animal and bird specific adoption and rescue
                                        sites and apps in order to quantify comparable services and digital features,
                                        distilling this information into a user and business profile.

                                        As this was a hypothetical business I created for this project, part of the
                                        challenge was defining the brand and current state of the rescue as well as
                                        designing the solutions. Based on my research of real world rescues and in
                                        partnership with my design mentor, I envisioned my rescue as having a very
                                        outdated website that was hard to navigate and cumbersome to actually get or
                                        provide information on. I was also able to use my previous branding experience
                                        to flesh out the visuals such as a logo and color scheme for this brand.
                                        <br>
                                        At this point, I was able to define the problem statement and create the below
                                        creative brief to help focus and guide my efforts. I did this by reviewing the
                                        data I had collected along with the branding I had created and pulled out the
                                        key points and takeaways that I wanted to focus on.

                                        In order to further identify pathways and opportunities, I created a user
                                        journey flow using my "current state" information. At this step I was able to
                                        identify a few new pain-points opportunities to improve in my design. These
                                        included: anxiety around whether or not a form was sent/received and a desire
                                        for the opportunity to share the bird with friends or take more time to think
                                        about the bird before adopting.

                                        <br>
                                        I then worked up a user map and site map to help map out my "future state". I
                                        included solutions to some of the pain points above by including confirmation
                                        messages when a form is sent and a favorites section the user can save birds in
                                        to view later as well as the opportunity to share the bird to social media.
                                        Below you can see the pathway for a user looking to adopt a parrot, which
                                        includes the above.

                                        I choose to focus on the full screen desktop design for the prototype as initial
                                        research indicated that users were more likely to fill out complex forms on a
                                        desktop than mobile devise. I started with wire frames and did some preliminary
                                        A/B user testing on content layout. This testing showed that each page was too
                                        high level and it took too many steps to get to the desired information. In the
                                        redesign I focused on making each page more information rich while still being
                                        easily scannable for quick information.

                                        high-fidelity prototypes reflective of the final web site. Next steps would
                                        include creating a guideline for the responsive design of each section of the

                                        I believe that I needed to spend more time during the planning stage on
                                        information architecture and naming conventions. I would do this by conducting a
                                        tree test to help clarify naming conventions and flesh out the card sort with
                                        additional levels of complexity.
                                        <br><br>

                                        Going forward, I would expand usability testing to a more diverse audience to
                                        see out any unaddressed pain points or accessibility concerns. I would also
                                        conduct market research on the need and appetite for a mobile app.

                                        I first guided the nonprofit representative through the creative process and
                                        ensured mutual clarity on project, goals, end user, and brand vision through a
                                        qualitative interview. Once I analyzed the feedback from this interview and the
                                        market and user research I conducted on my end, I decided to use a colorful
                                        palette to reflect of the brands vision of multi-cultural inclusively.
                                        First, I guided the non-profit representative through the creative process and
                                        clarified expectations, deliverables, and timeline. I then partnered with the
                                        representative to analyze the data they had available on the target customer and
                                        organizational objectives in order to provide targeted visual branding identity
                                        and digital assets. I next spent time researching and analyzing the brand vision
                                        of other non-profits with similar end goals to understand the market.

                                        After analyzing the data, we started to further define the user and what brand
                                        voice we wanted to use to reach them. We identified the user as a 30-50 year old
                                        mid-to-high income professionals from a variety of different cultures who live
                                        in the Minneapolis area and want to take action in their communities to make
                                        them more resilient to climate change. The voice was strong and inspiring.

                                        We then aligned on a project plan that was inclusive of all the required design
                                        and branding deliverables and TNA (shown below). These included an updated style
                                        guide, a logo, and custom logo and digital assets.

                                        With an understanding of the user and focused directive, I then began developing
                                        potential solutions to the design challenges. I started by creating a mood and
                                        color board inclusive of typeface in order to get early buy in from the
                                        organization representative on the overarching visual direction. We had some
                                        great dialogue around the mood board and after some discussion decided to add
                                        the multi-colored interlocked hands imagery that reflected the goal of engaging
                                        diverse cultures.

                                        With a narrowed direction I could start to create and iterate the logo and
                                        digital assets. Using adobe photoshop and illustrator, I worked through
                                        different color-ways and styles of design deliverables until I was satisfied
                                        with 3-4 to present to the client.

                                        For the logo, I chose a tree to represent the climate aspect and then partnered
                                        it with a person as the trunk to symbolize the union of man and nature.

                                        The representative had done some great website pre-planning so we were able to
                                        identify up front the specific areas we wanted to symbolize with icons and
                                        graphics. I first presented generic market images I thought visually represented
                                        each area well in order to get feedback on the icon visual direction and then
                                        proceeded to sketch and iterate each one in the same hand and palette as the
                                        logo.

                                        As this was a small non-profit, the testing phase was confined to the client and
                                        board leadership. This stage was more of a collaborative back and forth A/B
                                        testing as we discussed the visuals and any challenges or alterations that
                                        needed to be addressed in order to ensure the assets provided optimal design
                                        solutions.

                                        Given additional resources or the opportunity to be involved in the organization
                                        post launch, I would very much like to conduct additional research on the target
                                        user vs. the actual user in order to tweak any colors, visuals, or tones in the
                                        branding. I'd also like to get metrics to analyze around the website and conduct
                                        focus groups of the actual users in order to get feedback on how people view the
                                        site and the overarching impression they get from the visuals.

                                        &#8226;What I did well:
                                        <br>
                                        -The planning and communication was robust and extremely productive. This was
                                        achieved by doing extensive up front research and encouraging a reciprocal
                                        working relationship with the business representative that resulted in a shared
                                        understanding of the client's needs, expectations, and deliverables.
                                        <br>
                                        -The handoff of digital assets was well organized and easy for the client to
                                        work with. This was achieved by utilizing a shared google drive that contained
                                        the digital assets as well as an intuitive style guide that recorded the
                                        version history of the assets.

                                        &#8226;What could be improved:
                                        <br>
                                        -There was an opportunity on my part to improve communication by being more
                                        selective and brief when presenting my deliverables. Instead of presenting the
                                        number of options I should have had a more specific point of view with which to
                                        guide the business representative.

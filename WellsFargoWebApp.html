                                            The initial planning stage consisted of 3 parts and was undertaken by myself, the project manager, and the development leads.    This was both the easiest and hardest part of the project.

                                      The appraisal team already had a robust and dynamic excel document for creating appraisals as well as good training videos of how to use it. There was also an existing application for the residential appraisal team that was seen as a good starting point for the commercial application. This made it easy to walk in the user's footsteps and gain empathy for their process and pain points.  

                                      </p>

                                  <div class="right-about">
                                      <div>
                                      <h5>The Project Cons</h5>
                                      <p>
                                        The downside was because we had those tools, management did not feel we needed to take up the user's time by working with them directly, despite pushing for direct user input. As we worked to streamline the process, this did lead to some educated speculation on behalf of the user.
                                        In hindsight, it would have been ideal to go through the high fidelity prototype with the users and get sign off prior to proceeding with development. I was only involved in the user interface design but anticipate this causing more rework for the engineer team.

                                                    Once I understood the requirements and current state of the commercial appraisal business, I was able to compare against the existing residential app to determine what we could use, what could be improved, and what needed to be done from scratch from a user experience perspective. This was in partnership with the lead engineers who did the same thing from their perspective. In reality, only about 50% of the existing framework from residential was usable.
                                                    The residential application form UI was a PDF format that wasn't easily scannable for the user. It also wasn't responsive, which made it very hard to view on different devices.

                                                        Our combined analysis allowed us to partner on creating a general framework for the application. 
                                                        Text fields were cataloged with duplicative information reduced or combined in a separate excel doc by page. I then created a quick medium fidelity black/white mockup of the first few pages as a jumping off point to discuss the visual framework and conventions with internal team and get early buy in.

                            I began the UI piece by analyzing the Wells Fargo existing customer facing design system and referring to it as a base. As we progressed I modified the color and visual design system based on the the specific business needs. For example, I chose levels of the standard yellow to represent various hierarchies within the form. I also reduced the amount of space between form fields to help reduce the total length of the form while still maintaining readability. Due to time constraints and the need to multi task this process happened in tandem with creating the mid and high fidelity prototypes.
                               I documented all the visual standards in our <span class="links"><a  href="https://www.figma.com/proto/RtgMd0a7zWG0R6qxwNIVEJ/WEB-APP-V2?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=1%3A2&viewport=365%2C277%2C0.26&scaling=contain&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2 "  rel="noopener" target="_blank"> design system document.</a> </span>

                            The prototype was created and signed off on in 5-6 page groupings due to time restraints and the need to pass pages off to the engineering team during the next spring. This approach had the advantage of allowing us to quickly move to development but also created a lot of rework as we were always re-analyzing the complex and dynamic nature of the application and working through total user flows in pieces.

                            Part of my role was to bridge the gap between this process and an engineering team that was spread across 2 countries and time zones, relaying any changes, style updates, etc. To ensure clarity I took a multi-pronged approach to communication. During daily stand ups I would walk the team through any new information and reiterate changes via e-mail, which acted as a running change log. I also ensured the prototype, CSS, and design system document were up to date and the team had access to the files.

    <h5>A Responsive Design</h5>

        Once the mockup was signed off on by the product manager, I coded the initial HTML and CSS in Visual Code Studio for each type of page as a template to pass off the software engineers. Below is an example of the responsive design across 4 different devices.

                        Due to time constraints and lack of access to the end user, the initial testing I was involved in was done via cognitive walk through of the prototype with our product group. As each section was completed I partnered with engineer team to walk through and test application clarify, functionality, accessibility, and general usage. 
                        I also ensured the visual system and interactions met the quality and visual standards across the application.

                                                        My biggest takeaway from this project was the ability to work and solve problems independently as well as part of a team. As the requirements for the role changed I was tasked with coding templates in HTML and CSS, a weaker skill set before this role. 
                                                        The reality of the tight time frame meant that no one else on the team had the time to hold my hand as I learned. I was able to be successful in this role by taking responsibility for finding online resources and figuring it out as I went, a true trial and error process.

                                                        In reevaluating the design, I would have liked to have more time during the planning stage to work through information architecture. For instance, there were a lot of menus with different functionality and I think we could have spent more time breaking down the actual information architecture to make it more clear for the user and relied less on the existing excel documents and systems.

                <h5>If I Could Change One Thing:</h5>
                <p>                        Given different time restraints, I’d want to be involved in troubleshooting and gaining feedback upon the release to the business users. Ideally, this would be with a core group of business users that could provide structured feedback that would allow us to improve the application before a wide release.

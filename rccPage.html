                                        Once I analyzed all the data, I decided to use a colorful
                                        palette to reflect the brands vision of multi-cultural inclusively.

                                        With an understanding of the user and focused directive, I then began developing
                                        potential solutions to the design challenges. I started by creating a mood and
                                        color board inclusive of typeface in order to get early buy in from the
                                        organization representative on the overarching visual direction. We had some
                                        great dialogue around the mood board and after some discussion decided to add
                                        the multi-colored interlocked hands imagery that reflected the goal of engaging
                                        diverse cultures.

                                        With a narrowed direction I could start to create and iterate the logo and
                                        digital assets. Using adobe photoshop and illustrator, I worked through
                                        different color-ways and styles of design deliverables until I was satisfied
                                        with 3-4 to present to the client.
                                        <br><br>
                                        For the logo, I chose a tree to represent the climate aspect and then partnered
                                        it with a person as the trunk to symbolize the union of man and nature.
                                        <br><br>
                                        The representative had done some great website pre-planning so we were able to
                                        identify up front the specific areas we wanted to symbolize with icons and
                                        graphics. I first presented generic market images I thought visually represented
                                        each area well in order to get feedback on the icon visual direction and then
                                        proceeded to sketch and iterate each one in the same hand and palette as the
                                        logo.

                                        As this was a small non-profit, the testing phase was confined to the client and
                                        board leadership. This stage was more of a collaborative back and forth A/B
                                        testing as we discussed the visuals and any challenges or alterations that
                                        needed to be addressed in order to ensure the assets provided optimal design
                                        solutions.

                                        Given additional resources or the opportunity to be involved in the organization
                                        post launch, I would very much like to conduct additional research on the target
                                        user vs. the actual user in order to tweak any colors, visuals, or tones in the
                                        branding. I'd also like to get metrics to analyze around the website and conduct
                                        focus groups of the actual users in order to get feedback on how people view the
                                        site and the overarching impression they get from the visuals.

                                        -The planning and communication was robust and extremely productive. This was
                                        achieved by doing extensive up front research and encouraging a reciprocal
                                        working relationship with the business representative that resulted in a shared
                                        understanding of the client's needs, expectations, and deliverables.

                                        -The handoff of digital assets was well organized and easy for the client to
                                        work with. This was achieved by utilizing a shared google drive that contained
                                        the digital assets as well as an intuitive style guide that recorded the
                                        version history of the assets.

                                        -There was an opportunity on my part to improve communication by being more
                                        selective and brief when presenting my deliverables. Instead of presenting the
                                        number of options I should have had a more specific point of view with which to
                                        guide the business representative.

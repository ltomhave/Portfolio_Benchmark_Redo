                                    The Feathered Friends bird rescue wants to update and overhaul their website to
                                    streamline the experience for a user to view, support, foster, and adopt birds.

                                    &#8226; <span>THE CHALLENGES:</span>
                                    <br>
                                    The current website is older and hard to navigate and there isn't much information
                                    about the birds available. The secondary challenge is that with a small volunteer
                                    staff the rescue is overwhelmed with the current workload of paper forms.

                                    &#8226; <span>THE GOALS:</span>
                                    <br>To increase bird adoption and retention rate by 15% by connecting the right
                                    people with the right bird.

                                        I started my research with a deep dive questionnaire exercise with the business
                                        stakeholders (in this case my design mentor)to get qualitative research on the
                                        goals and frustrations of both the user and rescue operation. I then conducted
                                        extensive market research of other animal and bird specific adoption and rescue
                                        sites and apps in order to quantify comparable services and digital features,
                                        distilling this information into a user and business profile.

                                        As this was a hypothetical business I created for this project, part of the
                                        challenge was defining the brand and current state of the rescue as well as
                                        designing the solutions. Based on my research of real world rescues and in
                                        partnership with my design mentor, I envisioned my rescue as having a very
                                        outdated website that was hard to navigate and cumbersome to actually get or
                                        provide information on. I was also able to use my previous branding experience
                                        to flesh out the visuals such as a logo and color scheme for this brand.
                                        <br>
                                        At this point, I was able to define the problem statement and create the below
                                        creative brief to help focus and guide my efforts. I did this by reviewing the
                                        data I had collected along with the branding I had created and pulled out the
                                        key points and takeaways that I wanted to focus on.

                                        In order to further identify pathways and opportunities, I created a user
                                        journey flow using my "current state" information. At this step I was able to
                                        identify a few new pain-points opportunities to improve in my design. These
                                        included: anxiety around whether or not a form was sent/received and a desire
                                        for the opportunity to share the bird with friends or take more time to think
                                        about the bird before adopting.

                                        <br>
                                        I then worked up a user map and site map to help map out my "future state". I
                                        included solutions to some of the pain points above by including confirmation
                                        messages when a form is sent and a favorites section the user can save birds in
                                        to view later as well as the opportunity to share the bird to social media.
                                        Below you can see the pathway for a user looking to adopt a parrot, which
                                        includes the above.

                                        I choose to focus on the full screen desktop design for the prototype as initial
                                        research indicated that users were more likely to fill out complex forms on a
                                        desktop than mobile devise. I started with wire frames and did some preliminary
                                        A/B user testing on content layout. This testing showed that each page was too
                                        high level and it took too many steps to get to the desired information. In the
                                        redesign I focused on making each page more information rich while still being
                                        easily scannable for quick information.

                                        high-fidelity prototypes reflective of the final web site. Next steps would
                                        include creating a guideline for the responsive design of each section of the

                                        I believe that I needed to spend more time during the planning stage on
                                        information architecture and naming conventions. I would do this by conducting a
                                        tree test to help clarify naming conventions and flesh out the card sort with
                                        additional levels of complexity.
                                        <br><br>

                                        Going forward, I would expand usability testing to a more diverse audience to
                                        see out any unaddressed pain points or accessibility concerns. I would also
                                        conduct market research on the need and appetite for a mobile app.

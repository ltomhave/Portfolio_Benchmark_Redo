                    To increase bird adoption and retention rate by 15% by connecting the right
                    people with the right bird.

                    The current website is older and hard to navigate and there isn't much information
                    about the birds available. The secondary challenge is that with a small volunteer
                    staff the rescue is overwhelmed with the current workload of paper forms.

                    Based on user testing and feedback, I hypothesize that this website overhaul will meet expectations for the Feathered Friends company. If we were to take this to production, I would want to do analyze the business KPI's after 3 and 6 months to further test.

                                        designing the solutions. Based on my research of real world rescues and in
                                        partnership with my design mentor, I envisioned my rescue as having a very
                                        outdated website that was hard to navigate and cumbersome to actually get or
                                        provide information on. I was also able to use my previous branding experience
                                        to flesh out the visuals such as a logo and color scheme for this brand.

                                        In order to further identify pathways and opportunities, I created a user
                                        journey flow using my "current state" information. At this step I was able to
                                        identify a few new pain-points opportunities to improve in my design. These
                                        included: anxiety around whether or not a form was sent/received and a desire
                                        for the opportunity to share the bird with friends or take more time to think
                                        about the bird before adopting.

                                        <div class="photorow1">
                                            <div class="timeline-item">

                                                    <img src="img/BIRDS/BACKGROUND/6-SITE MAP.png" alt="site map document">

                                        <p>
                                        I then worked up a user map and site map to help map out my "future state". I
                                        included solutions to some of the pain points above by including confirmation
                                        messages when a form is sent and a favorites section the user can save birds in
                                        to view later as well as the opportunity to share the bird to social media.
                                        Below you can see the pathway for a user looking to adopt a parrot, which
                                        includes the above.

                                        I choose to focus on the full screen desktop design for the prototype as initial
                                        research indicated that users were more likely to fill out complex forms on a
                                        desktop than mobile devise. I started with wire frames and did some preliminary
                                        A/B user testing on content layout. This testing showed that each page was too
                                        high level and it took too many steps to get to the desired information. In the
                                        redesign I focused on making each page more information rich while still being
                                        easily scannable for quick information.

                                        high-fidelity prototypes reflective of the final web site. Next steps would
                                        include creating a guideline for the responsive design of each section of the
                                        website.

                                        goals identified during <a href="#kickoff">kickoff</a>, I created and performed
                                        a qualitative usability test.

                                        overarching takeaways were to clarify any ambiguous naming conventions, reassure
                                        the user as to the confidentiality of the application, and ensure the user is
                                        able to quickly select the type of class or volunteer opportunity they are
                                        looking for when signing up.

                                        tree test to help clarify naming conventions and flesh out the card sort with
                                        additional levels of complexity.

                                        Going forward, I would expand usability testing to a more diverse audience to
                                        see out any unaddressed pain points or accessibility concerns. I would also
                                        conduct market research on the need and appetite for a mobile app.
